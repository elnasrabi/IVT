# Virtualize
React components for efficiently rendering large, scrollable lists

It is inefficient to create and manage a large list of DOM elements within a scrolling container if only a few of those elements are visible. The primary purpose of this library is to improve performance by only rendering the DOM nodes that a user is able to see based on their current scroll position.

## VirtualScroll

This component renders a simple list of elements with a fixed height. It is similar to the [`react-infinite`](https://github.com/seatgeek/react-infinite) library's `Infinite` component but offers some additional functionality such as the ability to programmatically scroll to ensure that a specific row/item is visible within the container.

To use this component, simply provide it with a `height`, `rowHeight` and children like so:

```jsx
<VirtualScroll
  height={100}
  rowHeight={10}
>
  {list.map(row => (
    <div key={row.id}>
      {row.name}
    </div>
  ))}
</VirtualScroll>
```

You may also specify an additional `scrollToIndex` property to ensure that a certain row/index is visible. This can be useful for auto-scrolling to a search result or for showing the most recently added list item.

## FlexTable

The `FlexTable` component is based on Facebook's [`fixed-data-table`](https://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/) but has a more efficient DOM structure that allows for easier, more flexible styleing. It uses `VirtualScroll` internally to ensure that only visible table rows are rendered.

Its interface is very similar to the Facebook component:
```jsx
<Table
  width={300}
  height={300}
  headerHeight={25}
  rowHeight={40}
  rowGetter={rowGetter}
  rowsCount={list.size}
  sort={optionalSortFunction}
  sortBy={sortBy}
  sortDirection={sortDirection}
>
  <Column
    label='Name'
    dataKey='name'
    width={90}/>

  <Column
    width={210}
    disableSort
    label='Description'
    dataKey='description'
    cellDataGetter={
      (dataKey, rowData, columnData) => /* return computed value */
    }
    cellRenderer={
      (cellData, cellDataKey, rowData, rowIndex, columnData) => /* return custom-rendered cell */
    }
    flexGrow={1}/>
</Table>
```

`FlexTable` also provides an `AutoSizingTable` wrapper which will expand a given table to fill all of the available browser height below the table in the window.
